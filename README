Huge On Facebook is a jQuery plugin to display the number of Facebook "Likes" for any given list of links.

The plugin will traverse through a batch of links, fetch Open Graph data for each URL, and output a new <span> element containing the number of "likes" for each URL.

The plugin can additionally be set to display that number only if it's above a certain threshold, and to optionally add a class .HugeOnFacebook to each link—depending on how popular that link is. You get to decide how many shares is enough to bother showing your website visitor.
